     * and the {@link nl.quintor.solitaire.models.state.GameState#stock}, to represent a deck
     * of down-faced and up-faced cards respectively. This greatly simplifies counting the number of stock cycles, which
     * influence the score. It is also possible to implement this method using only the stock deck, but if score
     * calculation is implemented this requires maintaining a pointer to the first or last card in order to count the
     * cycles. Since the first or last card can be removed, this gets complicated really quickly. The move is stored in
     * {@link nl.quintor.solitaire.models.state.GameState#moves}.

     * @return result of cycling the stock, i.e. "Stock card 3 out of 14, cycle 1"
